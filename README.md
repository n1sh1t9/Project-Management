# Project-Management
-This project involved developing a comprehensive project plan for a non-profit organization focused on providing treatment for cancer patients. The project plan included 13 essential project management deliverables, such as a project charter, scope statement, risk matrix, cost estimate, and work breakdown structure.

-The project plan was formulated with a timeline-driven approach, and extensive research was conducted to identify key requirements and actions needed to ensure a smooth transition through each project phase.

-The deliverables were designed to effectively communicate the project scope, goals, timeline, budget, and potential risks to stakeholders and potential investors. This project highlights my project management skills and ability to plan and execute complex initiatives.
